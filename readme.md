Neural Population Decoding and Imbalanced Multi-Omic Datasets for Cancer Subtype Diagnosis
============================   
This is the code repository for the paper *Neural Population Decoding and Imbalanced Multi-Omic Datasets for Cancer Subtype Diagnosis*.



## 1)  `preprocessing.py`
First, we run this script to merge the omics data from the TCGA dataset into a single CSV file per cancer subtype, named `multi_omic.csv`. An example is provided using the BRCA dataset.

    │     ├── BRCA                  # Cancer subtypes
    |     |    ├── multi_omic.csv   # Will be generated by preprocessing.py
    |     |    ├── label.csv        # CSV containing patient IDs + target variable
    |     |    └── data             # Omics data for each patient

    │     └── ...                
    └── ...


## 2)  `self_organising_map.py`
Secondly, we use the multi-omic patient data from `multi_omic.csv` to generate a self-organising map using Kohonen's algorithm. Each patient in the dataset

    ├── self_organising_map.py        
    ├── ...                
    ├── patient_som_data        # Output folder created by self_organising_map.py
    │     ├── BRCA                  # Cancer subtypes
    |     |    ├── patient_0.png    # PNG image for each patient GSN
    |     |    ├── patient_1.png    
    |     |    ├── ...  
    |     |    ├── original.npy     # Tracks SMOTE vs original data
    |     |    ├── target.npy       # Target variable / labels
    |     |    └── SOM_data.npy     # GSNs for all patients
    |     |          
    │     ├── KIRC              # Same directory structure for each cancer subtype       
    │     └── ...

## References

The data used in `TCGA_data` as an example for those running the code is sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas, provided by National Cancer Institute. This dataset and more are available at https://www.cancer.gov/tcga

The code for the Hierarchical Bayesian Network via Spiking Neural Network was originally forked from the implementation by Otto van der Himst for the paper *Bayesian Integration of Information Using Top-Down Modulated WTA Networks*, available at https://github.com/Grottoh/WTA-Network

The implementation of self-organising maps and gene similiary networks in `self_organising_map.py` was originally forked from [iSOM-GSN](https://github.com/NaziaFatima/iSOM_GSN), although numerous alterations have been made in order to produce binarized GSN images rather than RGB. See Section 3 of the research paper for details.
