Neural Population Decoding and Imbalanced Multi-Omic Datasets for Cancer Subtype Diagnosis
============================   
This is the code repository for the paper *Neural Population Decoding and Imbalanced Multi-Omic Datasets for Cancer Subtype Diagnosis*.

The code for the Hierarchical Bayesian Network via Spiking Neural Network was forked from the implementation by Otto van der Himst for the paper *Bayesian Integration of Information Using Top-Down Modulated WTA Networks*, available at https://github.com/Grottoh/WTA-Network

## 1)  `preprocessing.py`
First, we run this script to merge the omics data from the TCGA dataset into a single CSV file per cancer subtype, named `multi_omic.csv`. An

## 2)  `self_organising_map.py`
Secondly, we use the multi-omic patient data from `multi_omic.csv` to generate a self-organising map using Kohonen's algorithm. Each patient in the dataset

This implementation was originally forked from [iSOM-GSN](https://github.com/NaziaFatima/iSOM_GSN), although numerous alterations have been made in order to produce binarized GSN images rather than RGB. See Section 3 of the research paper for details.
